# Contributing

Thanks for contributing!

## Development workflow

This repository is intentionally “no build step” (plain HTML/CSS/JS).
A local static server is recommended for testing:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

## Pull requests

- Keep changes focused and well-described.
- Avoid adding build tooling unless there is a strong reason.
- Prefer small, functional comments over change-log style notes in source files.
