# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is provided as-is. We generally only support the **latest** version available in the default branch.

If you are using a hosted deployment, please ensure you update to the latest release/commit when security fixes are published.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive reports.

Instead, use one of these options:

1) **Email (preferred):**    <a href="mailto:computerrhythm@gmail.com">
     computerrhythm@gmail.com
   </a>
2) **GitHub Security Advisories (private report):** If enabled for this repository, you can report via the repository’s **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability**.

When reporting, please include:
- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if safe)
- Affected browser(s)/OS and any connected MIDI hardware details
- Any suggested fix or mitigation (if you have one)

## Disclosure Process

After receiving a report, we will:
- Confirm receipt
- Investigate and validate the report
- Work on a fix and determine a release plan
- Coordinate a public disclosure when a fix is available (or when risk requires)

Thank you for helping keep users safe.
